decodebooster
=============

This is a simple tool that intends to boosts the performance of the decoders trying to decode the Ingress passcodes. It has a generic base converter, some encryption algorithms, conversion patterns common to passcodes. This is not an automated decoder, it can not decode on its own, the skill lies with the users. This is just an enabler..!
